Masters Home Improvement was an Australian home improvement chain operated by retailer Woolworths Limited. It was established as a way for Woolworths Limited to enter the hardware retail market, which has been historically dominated by Bunnings Warehouse, owned by rival Wesfarmers. The two companies also compete with each other with groceries, liquor, fuel and general merchandise. Most of the stores shared the same format of conventional Lowe's Home Improvement stores, and borrowed elements from Bunnings Warehouse for its garden and trade areas.
The joint venture was ultimately a failure for Woolworths Limited, accumulating losses of over A$3.2 billion over a 7-year period, and caused Woolworths to exit the hardware market, with all stores being closed and sold off by 11 December 2016. The failure is regarded as one of the biggest disasters in Australian retail history.
