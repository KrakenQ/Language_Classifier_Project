Khalid Jawad (1954 â€“ 6 September 1972) was one of eight Black September terrorists that invaded the Israeli quarters at the Munich Olympic Village during the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, taking hostage nine members of the Israeli Olympic delegation after killing Israeli wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg and weightlifter Yossef Romano in the initial takeover. It has been suggested that Jawad was the terrorist wearing the ski mask featured in images that became iconic of this atrocity.
