== Face Off ==
Face Off is a section in the show (introduced in the fifth series) where two of the presenting team go head-to-head in a 'face off' challenge. The loser has to wear a red shirt and stand in the 'danger' zone. The loser of the previous week gets to take on a different presenter the following week, with a chance of stepping out of the danger zone if they win the next challenge. The presenter who is wearing the red shirt at the end of the series has to face a forfeit.
