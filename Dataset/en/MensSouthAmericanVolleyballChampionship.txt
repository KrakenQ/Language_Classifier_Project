The Men's South American Volleyball Championship is the official competition for senior men's national volleyball teams of South America, organized by the Confederación Sudamericana de Voleibol (CSV). The initial gap between championships was variable, but since 1967 they have been awarded every two years. The competition has been dominated by Brazil, which won 32 of the 33 editions. The only tournament not won by Brazil was the 1964 championship, when the team did not compete due to political turmoil in the country.
