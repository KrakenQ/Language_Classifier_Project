Women's suffrage in Ecuador was introduced in 1929.   It was the first country in South America to introduce women's suffrage.
Women where explicitly excluded from suffrage in the constitution of 1884. In the constitution of 1897, women's rights were improved and the definition of a voter was made gender neutral, however it was still informally understood that women were not to exercise that right. The issue was raised by Matilde Hidalgo in 1924, which caused a public debate as well as a debate in Parliament. This prompted a process which ended in the introduction of women's suffrage in the new constitution of 1929.
