According to Wired, the company exploits "a failing of the new federal and state health insurance marketplaces: a lack of quick recommendations tailored to specific needs of consumers." It provides a search service for consumers to find a health plan that fits their unique needs and circumstances, "such as age, gender, illnesses, medications, doctors they want to see and smoking habits." Other sources refer to this service as a "recommendation engine."In January 2015, Stride Health launched a new mobile-focused version of its healthcare recommendation engine.


== Personnel ==
The company was founded by Noah Lang (formerly of Reputation.com) and Matt Butner (formerly of [R/GA]).
