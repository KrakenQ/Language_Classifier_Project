Notes on Nationalism is a weel-kent essay scrieved in Mey 1945 bi George Orwell in the jurnal Polemic, follaeing the Seicont Warld War. In the essay, Orwell gies an description o naitionalism, that he descreives as:

... first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled 'good' or 'bad.' ... [and] the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil and recognising no other duty than that of advancing its interests.
Here, he links naitionalism to pouer politics an gies ensamples o Positive Nationalism (fae a bodie's ain kintra; e.g., Celtic naitionalism or Zionism), Negative Nationalism (filk is against anither group; e.g., Antisemitism or anti-Soviet Trotskyism), an Transferred Nationalism (identification wi a race, class, or kintra ither than a bodie's ain). He gies a disctinction atween this naitionalism an patriotism forby.  "Patriotism is of its nature defensive.... Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power.".Ae observation makit bi Orwell, that is that it is anely nationalists fa pit ony amoont o importance ontae the uiss o Scots, haes been criticised bi Scots-leid speakers. Notes on Nationalism haes been uised bi fowk on the richt-weeng o politics (includin umwhile Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson) tae argie agin 'identity politics'.
