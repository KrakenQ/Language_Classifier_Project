"Three O'Clock in the Morning" is a waltz composed by Juli√°n Robledo that was extremely popular in the 1920s. Robledo published the music as a piano solo in 1919, and two years later Dorothy Terriss wrote the lyrics. Paul Whiteman's instrumental recording in 1922 became one of the first 20 recordings in history to sell over 1 million copies.
